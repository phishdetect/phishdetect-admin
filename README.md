# PhishDetect Admin

This software is part of the PhishDetect project.

This is a simple Flask web application that is meant to run locally in order to remotely connect and manage a PhishDetect Node. You can simply install it with:

```
pip3 install phishdetect-admin
```

Once installed, you can launch it with:

```
phishdetect-admin
```

It will spawn a local webserver and automatically open a tab on your default browser pointing to it. You will then be asked to configure the PhishDetet Node you wish to operate by providing the base URL and your API key.
